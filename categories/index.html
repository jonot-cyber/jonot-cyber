NeoVim is a fork of Vim, which is itself a clone of Vi. To start this post, I feel like I should explain why I am basically using a text editor from 1976:
The first point is probably the most obvious, but Vim is fast. Vim is designed around doing things with a keyboard, and overall keeping your fingers on the home row, which allows you to type faster.</article></a><a class=article-link href=/posts/fedora-silverblue/><article><h2 class=summary-title>Fedora Silverblue</h2>Since the beginning of January I have been using Fedora Silverblue on my home computer. In this article, I thought that I would explain a bit about how I use it, why, and the pros and cons of using it for general use and development
What is Fedora Silverblue? As this website states, Fedora Silverblue is a variant of Fedora Workstation where the root filesystem is immutable, meaning you can&rsquo;t change it, which makes every root installation the same.</article></a><a class=article-link href=/posts/hex-words/><article><h2 class=summary-title>The longest word you can spell in hexadecimal</h2>It&rsquo;s &ldquo;coldblooded&rdquo;
This is something that I did a while ago, so I thought I&rsquo;d just write a post about it. Here is a shell script to get every word that can be spelled with hexadecimal, sorted by length:
cat /usr/share/dict/words | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]" | grep -E "^[abcdeflzso]+$" | tr "lzso" "1250" | awk '{print length, "0x" $0}' | sort -nr -k 1 | cut -d " " -f 2 If that seems incredibly cryptic to you, don&rsquo;t worry.</article></a><a class=article-link href=/posts/running-android/><article><h2 class=summary-title>Running Android</h2>WARNING: This blog post comes with no warranty. It should be made clear that I do not know any of what I am doing.
I recently found out that Waydroid, a container-based system to run android apps on Linux, got added to the Fedora repos. I have occasionally tried installing Waydroid with very little success, but this official support from my distro gave me new hope. So I decided to try it out again.</article></a><a class=article-link href=/posts/sitelen-pona-tester/><article><h2 class=summary-title>Sitelen Pona Tester</h2>toki! mi pali e lipu sin
Recently I&rsquo;ve released my new website that allows you to practice sitelen pona symbols, by giving you a symbol and four words, and you have to select the one that matches:
Alright, maybe I should explain somethings
Toki Pona Toki Pona is a conlang created by Sonja Lang in 2001. A conlang is a language that was created deliberately, instead of emerging naturally.
One of the main principles of Toki Pona is minimalism.</article></a><a class=article-link href=/posts/video-format-comparison/><article><h2 class=summary-title>A Comparison of GIF Replacements</h2>IMPORTANT NOTE I have repeatedly had problems with this article due to the large file size of the videos. At this point I have decided to reduce all of the videos to 1 second to reduce this. The text all applies still, but you&rsquo;ll have to encode the files yourself if you want to see what they look like in full.
The GIF file format was created in 1987, and it definitely shows.</article></a><a class=article-link href=/posts/reader-mode/><article><h2 class=summary-title>Reader Mode</h2>Have you ever been on a website? It can be really annoying. Many pages have an absurd amount of ads, and a lot of sites have limits on how much you can read before they ask you to sign up for some account or get a newsletter or whatever.
It&rsquo;s annoying enough, but it&rsquo;s more annoying on a dual-core Intel Celeron processor with 4 GB of ram. So a while ago, I created a bookmarklet.</article></a><a class=article-link href=/posts/ideas/><article><h2 class=summary-title>Ideas</h2>Ideas is a really simple program, and yet out of all of the programs I have made, it is probably the one I have used the most. It&rsquo;s so short, in fact, that I&rsquo;ll just put the entire source code into this post:
#!/usr/bin/env python3 from pathlib import Path import os # Folder for ideas IDEAS_FOLDER = Path(os.environ["HOME"]) / ".local/share/ideas/" def main(): title = input("What is your idea? ") print("Interesting, tell me more.</article></a></main></div></body></html>
